# Upload-Files-On-Google-Drive-GoogleScript-
So I was learning and working on a new thing which is google script.You can now upload files on google drive using google script. Just open script.google.com and make a Index.html file and one Code.gs then copy paste my code in that project accordingly. After that set your version and deploy your web app and enjoy uploading files on google drive with google script.
